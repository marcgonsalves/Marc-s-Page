<p> My name is Marc, I am a student at <span style="color:green"> <b> Byrne Creek </b> </span> Secondary school where I am in the 9th grade. I have lived in three different countries before and it was early 2020 when I had just moved to Canada. At first, I was attending a school called Taylor Park Elementary but after graduating, I have now moved to <span style="color:green"> <b> Byrne Creek </b> </span> with my fellow friends. Byrne Creek is a great school and I still got three more years of education before I graduate so I hope to make the most of it! </p>
