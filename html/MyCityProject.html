<h2 style="color:green"> Famous Locations </h2>

<h3> Downtown Park </h3>

<p> One of Bellevue's famous location is Downtown Park. It is a twenty acre farm that consists of a circular ring with a large central greenspace that is surrounded by a
moat and walking trails. There are many picnic areas located inside the park with views of the skyline and Mount Ranier. If you want a nice place to relax and spend time 
with family, then Downtown Park is the place for you. </p>

<h3> Crossroads Mall </h3>

<p> Another one of Bellevue's astute locations is the Crossroads Mall. This is my personal favorite location as it was next to my first apartment. I spent my childhood at
this mall and trust me when I say, it's a lot more than just a mall. The mall is open every day and has many stores, necessities, and a food court to eat at. Outside of the
mall there are two different playgrounds, a basketball park, a water area, and a nice long track to ride your bike or scooter. Your kids could even play chess or visit the 
library under supervision! I recommend you to visit this mall because it is a great place to waste time or just relax. </p>

<h3> Botanical Gardens </h3>

<p> The last location in this list is the Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Gardens are located East of Downtown Bellevue. The garden gets 300,000 visits a year due to it's amazing
beauty, scents, and wildlife. In winter, they have a special event where they decorate the gardens with LED lights. They make animals out of these lights that kids have to find as a
scavenger hunt. It is one of Bellevue's most scenic locations and I recommend you to visit it ASAP! </p>
